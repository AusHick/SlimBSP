SlimBSP
=======


This is a slimmed down version of the map compile tools from [Valve's Source SDK 2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013). It also features many community-created features and improvements that should maintain compatibility with the standard 2013 branch engine.

----------

Features
----------

 - Completely standalone from the Source SDK
 - Large address aware binaries
 - Smoothing groups applied to func_details ([tgnottingham](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/pull/391))
 - Option to disable default cubemaps \[-nodefaultcubemap\] ([wouterpleizier](https://github.com/wouterpleizier/source-sdk-2013/commit/8a102a7b6d6e821bc77925a3df241cfad70876e7))

More Info
---------

While this project is intended to keep as much compatibility with the standard HL2 engine as possible, it is developed with Garry's Mod in mind. Should Garry's Mod add new capabilities for mappers, it is likely to break that compatibility.
